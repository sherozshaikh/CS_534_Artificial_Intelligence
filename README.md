## 📄 Abstract
As digital transactions continue to grow in number, credit card fraud has become a major concern. This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at evaluating and comparing the performance of four machine learning methods for detecting credit card fraud. The algorithms examined are Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), all applied to a credit card fraud dataset with over 2.4 million transactions. Given the high imbalance in the dataset (most transactions are not fraudulent), we address this with resampling techniques. Our goal is to minimize false negatives, ensuring that all instances of fraud are detected. We train, evaluate, and compare the models, emphasizing not just accuracy but also sensitivity.
